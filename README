Description: The METAnalyzer package is a new tool for plant breeding researchers. 
    It helps estimate probabilities in multi-environmental trials, accounting for the uncertainty resulting from using only a small sample of possible environments. 
    This tool enables users to compare genotypes in novel ways, such as creating rank confidence intervals and determining the likelihood of genotypes performing better in various environments.
