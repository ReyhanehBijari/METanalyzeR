Description: METanalyzeR is a tool designed for plant breeding researchers to analyze experiments while considering the uncertainty resulting from complex genotypes by environment interactions. This package provides the capability to estimate probabilities in multi-environmental trials using a limited sample of possible environments. It enables users to compare genotypes in innovative ways, such as creating rank confidence intervals and assessing the likelihood of genotypes performing better across different environments.
